            Â½ red onion, sliced
            1 medium tomato, sliced
            2 cloves garlic, minced
            1 tablespoon aji amarillo paste
            2 tablespoons soy sauce
            1 tablespoon white vinegar
            1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped

            <h2>Prep</h2>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over high heat.</li> 
            <li> Sear the steak, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned, 5-6 minutes. Remove from the pan.</li>
                Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then add the red onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until softened and browned. Add the tomato, garlic, and aji amarillo paste, and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes have released some of their juices, but are still intact.
                Add the soy sauce and vinegar and stir to combine, let cook for 1 minute.
                Add the steak, fries, and cilantro. Toss gently to coat the fries in the sauce.
                Serve with rice, if desired.</li>
